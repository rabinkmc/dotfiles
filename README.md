configuration files

1. config - This is the configuration of my i3wm. The config is derived
   from i3-manjaro's config.
2. init.vim - neovim configuration
3. install.sh - this is intended to be the install script after a new
   arch/manjaro install 
4. 90-touchpad.conf - touchpad doesn't work out of the box in
   i3-manjaro. So, just a conf for that.
