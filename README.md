## configuration files

### config 
This is the configuration of my i3wm. The config is derived
   from i3-manjaro's config.
   
### init.vim 
neovim configuration

###  install.sh
This is intended to be the install script after a new arch/manjaro install 

### 90-touchpad.conf 
touchpad doesn't work out of the box in i3-manjaro. So, just a conf for that.
